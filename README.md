# SSEE 2024 Project

## Project details

This project and results come from an experiment conducted in 2024, the experiment conducted used an out crossed population of diverse strains of wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae and puts them in four separate treatment conditions to assess their multicellularity in each. The project is split up into Raw Data, Edited Data (clean) files, R files and Results. 

|Treatment conditions|
| ------------- |:-------------: |
| GAL           |GAL SETTLING  | 
| YPD           |YPD SETTLING  | 

GAL and YPD media are the same except for their carbon source, meaning they both contain 10 g/L Yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone, and 20g/L carbon source which is either galactose or dextrose. The settling treatments were both places under 5 minutes of settling in a 1.5 mL tube where 100 micro liters of sample from each culture grown in 1mL of liquid in a 24 well plate was taken. The settling selection for the culture was completed by letting the 100 microliters settling for 5 minutes then taking the top 90 micro liters off leaving behind 10 micro liters that was then transferred to start the next 1 mL culture.

## Data Details

### OD Data

The data in this project was generated through a few different ways. The OD data was taken everyday at the same time using a spectrophotometer and by taking 990 microliters of water and 10 microliters of sample in a cuvette and then vortexing to mix. The settled ODs for settling selection were taken by parallel settling two 100 micro liter samples from the same culture and transferring one of them and using the other one to measure its OD. This method while not perfect should showcase an accurate OD of the settled culture as the culture was mixed well before the two subset were taken and should be very similar in OD. 

### Phenotyping Data

This data was obtained by counting number of cells in the first 100 groups on a hemocytometer from left to right. This process was done by taking 10 mL of culture and adding 190 mL of 50 mM sodium EDTA. This was used as a defloculant to make sure the cells seen were clonal multicellularity. However, no flocculation was seen during the experiment. This process was done every four days during the experiment for a total of eight times.
